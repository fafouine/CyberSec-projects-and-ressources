Fan-out broadcaster for operator WebSocket connections

OpsManager keeps a set of active operator WebSocket connections.
connect accepts a new connection; broadcast serializes an event dict
as JSON and sends it to all connected operators, silently dropping
any connections that fail to send.

Connects to:
  beacon/router.py - broadcast called for beacon connect/disconnect/result
  ops/router.py - connect, disconnect, and broadcast called per operator
  __main__.py - creates singleton on startup
